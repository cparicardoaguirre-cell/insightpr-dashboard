However, the balance sheet reveals a constrained liquidity position (Quick Ratio 0.63) driven by substantial inventory holdings ($1.34M) and aggressive leverage (Debt-to-Equity 2.70x). While the company effectively leverages this debt to generate high Returns on Equity (79.52%), the reliance on inventory turnover and floorplan financing presents a specific risk profile that requires careful monitoring of inventory aging. Note: Cash flow analysis was limited by the truncated source data for this specific file revision."
