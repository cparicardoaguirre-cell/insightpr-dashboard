The company's Return on Equity (148%) is exceptionally high, driven by a lean equity base and high asset turnover (2.30x). Liquidity is adequate (Current Ratio 2.01), but the low Quick Ratio (0.63) and Cash Ratio (0.16) highlight a dependence on inventory turnover to meet obligations. A material discrepancy exists between the 'Rev156' draft data ($423k Net Income) and other 'Audited' versions ($182k Net Income) found in the source library, suggesting the 'Rev156' file may be a pre-tax-adjustment or internal draft version."
