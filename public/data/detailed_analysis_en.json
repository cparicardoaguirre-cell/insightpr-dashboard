However, the company operates with high leverage (Debt/Equity 2.70) and significant inventory lock-up (140 days to sell). While short-term liquidity appears adequate (Current Ratio 2.01), the Quick Ratio of 0.63 highlights that solvency is heavily dependent on the ability to liquidate inventory. The high ROE (79.5%) is largely a function of the low equity base relative to debt."
