While Profitability margins (Net Margin 9.32%) appear robust and above industry averages, this specific financial revision appears to exclude Depreciation expenses and Fixed Assets [2], which likely inflates reported efficiency and profitability metrics compared to standard GAAP presentation. The discrepancy between the high Operating Profit and the low Quick Ratio (0.63) suggests that while the company books sales effectively, cash is immediately reinvested into heavy inventory levels rather than liquid reserves."
