The company is highly efficient in collecting receivables (DSO 37 days) but shows weakness in Inventory Turnover (140 days), suggesting potential overstocking. While Net Profit Margins (9.32%) are healthy, Gross Margins (22.73%) trail the high-performing benchmarks for the rental/sales industry, likely due to high cost of goods sold. The high ROE (79.52%) is driven largely by the leveraged capital structure."
