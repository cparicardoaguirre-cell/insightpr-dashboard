  "overallAnalysis": "This analysis utilizes the Final Audited Financial Statements [1]-[7] dated January 29, 2026, rejecting the preliminary data found in draft files 'Rev156-1'.\n\n1. **Evolution of Data:** The transition from draft to final audit resulted in a drastic reduction in reported Inventory (from ~$1.3M to $339k) and Net Income (from ~$423k to $182k). This correction significantly impacted the Current Ratio (dropping from 2.01 to 1.16) and Inventory Turnover (improving mathematically due to the lower denominator).\n\n2. **Solvency & Leverage:** The company operates with high leverage (Debt-to-Equity 5.29), driven by a small equity base. However, the Interest Coverage Ratio (4.58) remains healthy, indicating the company can currently service its debt.\n\n3. **Profitability:** Gross Margins (14.18%) are below typical industry benchmarks for equipment distributors, suggesting pressure on pricing or high cost of sales. However, the company is highly efficient with its assets (ROA 9.96%), mitigating the impact of thin margins."
