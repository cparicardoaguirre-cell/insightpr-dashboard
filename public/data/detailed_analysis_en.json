  "overallAnalysis": "AUDIT LOG & EVOLUTION OF DATA: This analysis is based strictly on the 'FINAL AUDITED' figures signed on January 29, 2026 [1], which supersede the 'Draft/Rev156-1' [2] and 'Rev156-3' internal documents. \n\n1. MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS: The draft financial statements [2] showed Net Income of $423,154 and Inventory of $1.34M. The Final Audited Report [1, 3] reduced Net Income to $182,722 and Inventory to $339,039. This massive write-down (-$1M in assets) fundamentally altered the ratio profile, shifting the company from 'Healthy Liquidity' (Draft Current Ratio 2.01) to 'Tight Liquidity' (Final Current Ratio 1.16). \n\n2. SOLVENCY CONCERN: The adjustments eroded the Equity base to $291,686, resulting in a dangerously high Debt-to-Equity ratio of 5.29. The company is now heavily dependent on creditor financing (84% Debt-to-Assets). \n\n3. OPERATIONAL REALITY: Despite the balance sheet adjustments, the core operation remains efficient (Asset Turnover 2.47x) with strong collections (DSO 37 days). The strain is primarily in the capitalization structure and the realization of inventory losses."
